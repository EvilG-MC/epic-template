## 📚 BOT TEMPLATE
* This is a template I made out of boredom, and wanting to contribute something.
* Don't expect too much for something I did quickly and from someone who wastes time.

This repo uses the: [MIT](LICENSE.md) license.

### 🚀 Installation 

1. Clone the repo: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EvilG-MC/epic-template.git
```

2. Install dependencies (I use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)): 
```bash
npm install
```

3. Compile the bot: 
* Because it is a typescript bot running in javascript.
```bash
npm run compile 
```

3. Start the bot: 
* If everything is ok, it should run haha.
```bash
npm run start
```

### 🐧 Disclaimer
* Don't wait the best code practices, I did the best with this.
* Add/Remove what you want, it is modifiable.
